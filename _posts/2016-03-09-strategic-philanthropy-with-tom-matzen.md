description: "When you think of the term strategic philanthropy, one company comes to mind: Tom's Shoes. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't heard of them. For every pair of shoes someone buys from them, they send another pair to a developing country. That strategy, do good to make money, has made them incredibly successful."
